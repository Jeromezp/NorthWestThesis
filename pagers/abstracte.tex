\vspace{1em}

\textbf {\large Abstract: }\normalsize{With the advent of the era of big data, various organisms omics data (such as genome,proteome, etc.) showing a trend of rapid growth. Through preliminary investigation found that a morethorough study and organisms (such as Arabidopsis, yeast, etc.) omics data, compared to Malus'smulti-omics data resources in recent years, was able to open access, the data distribution is morefragmented, lack of a unified and efficient management. In order to solve these problems, the
establishment of a multi-omics malus Management System, Malus's multi-omics data integration of resources and effective management. The system uses Struts2 framework to MySQL database, Apache server, combined with JavaScript, Css, Html, Bootstrap and other languages and technology, (1) to achieve a malic 95,232 genes and 95,232 protein sequences, delete, query , modify the basic operation;(2) the use of BLAST sequence alignment tool, Malus realized gene and protein sequence similarity
comparisons and screening; (3) in order to better understand the apple gene or protein function, the
system also provides Arabidopsis Malus similarity search function in gene and protein sequences aspects
of visualization in the genome-wide similarity metric, the site provides links to functional annotation to
help users of the system by means of research more thorough gene or protein function in Arabidopsis,
reasoning apple corresponding homologous gene or protein function. The Malus species researchers have
some practical value}
