\textbf {\large Abstract: }\normalsize{The researchers collected every day into the genome data, check data effectively is very important. A genome visualization belongs to data visualization, data visualization is equivalent to the theory and method in the application of genomics data. Due to the unique genomic data, so it has some unique visualization methods produce genome the visualization tool.Web end gradually by a large number of researchers sought.GBrowse as Web terminal gene data visualization tools, for most of the known biological data were visualized, and it has strong scalability, especially based on large-scale biological data string has obvious advantages. This paper through the Web genome browser GBrowse, the mainstream JBrowse, UCSC Genome Browser was studied, and the GBrowse as the main Compared to Apple tool genes and other Rosaceae species gene visualization, in a more friendly way to researchers, to help researchers more thorough analysis on the differences between apple genome sequence homology and similarity, has actual application value for the gene researchers.}
